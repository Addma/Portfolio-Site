        <div className={className}><p>  Welcome to my website. My name is Adam Araujo. I'm a fourth year Computer Science student interested in Front-End development.
            I chose computer science as my major as I enjoyed my highschool experience and wanted to create and solve difficult problems and being able to develop programs was extremely
            interesting to me. Over time, I started learning web development while striving to improve my work. In my free time I enjoy gaming, nature and weightlifting :-)
