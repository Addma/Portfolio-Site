            <p>
            I chose computer science as my major as I enjoyed my highschool experience of CS courses and enjoyed the rush from problem solving. 
            While taking courses at York University I became interested in web dev and expanded knowledge from there through internships.

            <p>In my free time I enjoy gaming, nature and weightlifting :-)</p>
